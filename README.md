# Project Name: EmotionAid

## Emotional-Wellness
An AI-powered platform that uses NFTs and visual tools to help individuals identify, track, and manage their emotions. 
It provides users with resources and professional assistance for emotional well-being.

### Problem Statement:
Emotional well-being is often neglected, and current solutions like the “emotional wheel” are not effective for everyone,
especially for highly sensitive individuals. Mental health challenges are increasing, and a personalized, tech-driven approach could offer better support.

### Approach:
A wearable device integrated with blockchain and AI that monitors emotional states and provides real-time feedback.
The device would identify emotions and suggest immediate resources or strategies for managing them, helping individuals regain control of their emotional well-being. 
Professionals can also use this data to provide tailored support.

### Vision:
Create a world where mental health care is more personalized and accessible, allowing individuals to address emotional issues before they escalate into more severe conditions.
 This would also improve early diagnosis and treatment for mental health professionals.

### Technologies/Tools:

- AI for Emotional Recognition: To monitor and interpret emotional states.
  
- Wearable Technology (Smartwatch, etc.): To collect and display emotional data.
  
- Aptos Blockchain: To securely store personal emotional data and protect privacy.
  
- Move Smart Contracts: For managing professional consultations and treatments.

  ### Scalability:
Once proven, this technology could be offered to therapists, hospitals, and well-being centers worldwide.
The data generated could also help in research on emotional health trends and preventative mental health care.
